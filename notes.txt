three.min.js:92 THREE.WebGLProgram: gl.getProgramInfoLog() C:\fakepath(87,1-6): warning X4000: use of potentially uninitialized variable (dyn_index_vec4_float4_int)


Moving from r84 to r120 of Three.js is quite a jump - that's good that you've only encountered minor issues so far. The main attribute change you probably hit was the switch from `.attributes` to `.getAttribute()`, which was one of the bigger breaking changes in that period.

Since you're doing such a significant version upgrade, you might want to watch out for a few other potential issues that could come up, particularly with shaders:

1. Shader precision defaults changed
2. Some uniform naming conventions were updated
3. The WebGLRenderer parameters changed somewhat
4. Material property naming evolved in some cases

Would you like me to keep an eye out for any other version-specific changes as we discuss your Three.js implementation? I can flag anything that might need attention during the upgrade process.
